# The Problem We're Solving

Imagine a small rental desk trying to manage everything with paper, or maybe just a messy spreadsheet. It's easy to make mistakes: forgetting a car is out, miscalculating a bill, or double-booking a vehicle.

Our Goal: To stop the chaos! We're building a simple, digital tool that instantly tells the rental agent the fleet status and handles the calculations, making the rental process reliable and hassle-free.

#Where Does This Project Stop? (The Scope)

This is a proof-of-concept, or "minimum viable product." It focuses on the absolute essentials.

**Yes, we do this:**
* Keep track of which cars are **Available** or **Rented**.
* Log a new rental with a customer name and how long they plan to rent for.
* Calculate the up-front, estimated cost.

**No, we DON'T do this:**
* **Saving Data:** When you close the program, all records are wiped clean. It's like a whiteboard, not a hard drive!
* **Fancy Features:** No late fees, no processing credit cards, no complex database searches.
* **Web or App:** This is strictly a text-based tool run in the terminal.

# (Target Users)

* **The Rental Desk Superstars:** Agents who process rentals and returns all day. They need quick answers and accurate numbers.
